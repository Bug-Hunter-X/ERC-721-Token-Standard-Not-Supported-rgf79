This Dapp has a bug in that it does not support ERC-721 tokens. This means that it will not work correctly with tokens that conform to the ERC-721 standard. The bug is in the balanceOf function which does not account for ERC-721 tokens. The solution is to modify the balanceOf function to account for the ERC-721 standard. This will require adding a check to see if the token is an ERC-721 token and if it is, then the balance should be returned correctly.
